145151991927156736	@bmvaughn Did you ask someone at the store to clarify?
145151921429291008	@bmvaughn It's not a sale tag......but I do understand that the prices shown are different. Very strange....mostly likely a misprint.
145151091405881344	@dawnsteed Sorry to hear about this. Was the store able to offer you something better?

145732907187712001	When was the last time a fight was decided by a referee awarding TWO penalty points for pushing? Utterly absurd. @AmirKingKhan was robbed.
145732042510962689	Outrageous. @AmirKingKhan robbed by the referee. Disgusting decision.
145731629158109185	American commentators on HBO saying penalty points not justified.
145730918953398272	My verdict is narrow win for @AmirKingKhan after a great fight. But this referee's outrageous 2 pushing penalty points could change that.

145598122956029952	If the Lakers get Okafor in the CP3 deal, I hope they don't spin Bynum to Indy, Minny or Portland for multiple pieces. That would scare me.
145567144338403328	My kids are fighting over who gets to play a "Beavis & Butthead shoot spitballs at their teacher" iPad game. I couldn't be prouder.
145531178538123265	I'm talking all my Celts trash now... you know, before we give away a catatonically disgruntled Rondo for Collison & Hibbert. (Damn it all.)
145529797479636992	Knicks fans are making "old" jokes about my Celts and pretending they aren't starting Mike Bibby's corpse on X-Mas day. The rivalry is back!
145526539814051840	I love it - the Knicks fans are talking trash. The Celts-Knicks rivalry is back! (Well, until Amar'e goes down and you can't amnesty him.)
145524604843208706	Knicks picked up Chauncey's option ($14.2m) in April, now they're amnesty-ing him + aren't protected for Amar'e contract. Savvy!
145363869236346880	Can't see how the Celts pull off a West signing without it being a double sign-and-trade for Jeff Green. Is that even legal? My head hurts.

144961013043834882	This is crazy: Hearing the NBA (owner of New Orleans) vetoed the CP3 trade because it wasn't in the best interests in the league.

144816852449763328	Standing by my Day 4 prediction http://t.co/WeqbrX0E - still think CP3 + Chandler end up in GSW (and that GSW is playing possum with Curry).
144811956417740800	Celts now "all-in" w/ the CP3 chase. Can't see Rondo ever being happy in Boston now. if they bring him back, he will check out. CP3 or bust.
