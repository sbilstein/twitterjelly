Commit early and commit often!

Quick tips for the unitiated in git:

git add .
~Adds all new files in directory that are not yet part of the repo

git commit -m "SWAG"
~Commits to the local master branch, not to the github repo

git push master origin
~pushes your master branch up top to the github reco
~you need to commit locally before you do this

Best practices recommedn you create a local branch as soon as you start working, then commit locally. When you are done merge into your master branch...then test :) then push to the origin. I'll be damn surprised if this gains traction.
